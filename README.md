99 ways to "hack" private information posted to a public website with no security


April 11, 2018 the Nova Scotia Government order the raid of a 19 year old who had downloaded 7000 documentes from the Freedom of Information website, alleging that accessing public data was a hack.

The worldwide InfoSec and IT communities have responded with concern, contempt, and amusement. https://evandentremont.com/some-information-on-the-freedom-of-information-hack/ is an introductory blog post. The EFF has responded: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/dear-canada-accessing-publicly-available-information-internet-not-crime?page=3 

The Nova Scotia Government would have you belive that accessing publicly posted information is a crime, and that having very, very, basic computer skills is a risk worthy of response of 15 police officers.

Ignorance leads to fear, etc, etc. I am disgusted that my Government is operating their IT services from a place of fundamental ignorance, thus this project.

In the style of http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/ I hope to document at least 99 ways to execute this "hack".
